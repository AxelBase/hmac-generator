Acceptance of Terms</h2> <p>By accessing or using the <strong>HMAC-SHA256 Generator</strong>, you agree to be bound by these Terms 
      and Conditions. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use immediately. These terms govern your 
      use of the utility, including any features, updates, or documentation provided by AxelBase.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">2. Tool Purpose</h2> <p>The HMAC-SHA256 Generator is designed to help developers create HMAC hashes securely within their 
      browser. It is intended solely for educational, testing, and development use. The tool does not 
      replace professional security auditing or enterprise-grade cryptographic management.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">3. No Data Storage</h2> <p>The tool performs all hashing operations client-side and does not store, transmit, or log any keys, 
      messages, or generated outputs. You are entirely responsible for safeguarding any sensitive data 
      entered into the utility.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">4. User Responsibilities</h2> <p>By using the tool, you agree that you will:</p> <ul><li>Use the tool lawfully and ethically.</li> <li>Avoid using the tool to generate hashes for malicious activity.</li> <li>Ensure all cryptographic materials you input are handled securely on your device.</li> <li>Take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access to your environment.</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1e0rsuc">5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2> <p>The HMAC-SHA256 Generator is provided on an <em>“as-is”</em> and <em>“as-available”</em> basis. 
      AxelBase makes no warranties regarding reliability, accuracy, availability, or suitability for a 
      specific purpose. Results from the tool should be independently verified before use in
