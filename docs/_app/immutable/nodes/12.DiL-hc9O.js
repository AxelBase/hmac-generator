Overview</h2> <p>The <strong>HMAC-SHA256 Generator</strong> is a cryptographic tool created by AxelBase to help developers 
      securely generate HMAC hashes in a simple, browser-based interface. This Privacy Policy explains how 
      your information is handled while using the utility. Because the tool is built on a <strong>zero-logging</strong>, <strong>zero-storage</strong>, and <strong>100% client-side architecture</strong>, 
      your data never leaves your device.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">2. What We Do Not Collect</h2> <p>To maintain complete user privacy, we do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any of the following:</p> <ul><li><strong>Personal information</strong> such as your name, email address, location, or IP address.</li> <li><strong>Cryptographic inputs</strong> including secret keys, messages, imported files, or generated hashes.</li> <li><strong>Analytics or usage data</strong>; we do not run tracking scripts, ad pixels, or cookies.</li> <li><strong>Device or browser data</strong> beyond what your browser already handles locally.</li></ul> <p>Every operation—secret key parsing, message encoding, hash generation, and file imports—happens 
      entirely inside your browser via JavaScript. No data is transmitted to any server.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">3. How the Tool Operates</h2> <p>The HMAC-SHA256 Generator uses modern browser cryptography APIs to create hashes. 
      All logic runs client-side, and the tool does not communicate with external services. 
      Any files you import are processed in memory only, and are immediately discarded when you close or 
      refresh the page.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">4. Third-Party Services</h2> <p>The tool does not integrate analytics, ads, remote scripts, or any third-party collectors. 
      Open-source libraries that may exist in the bundle run locally and do not transmit data externally.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">5. Cookies</h2> <p>The HMAC-SHA256 Generator uses <strong>no cookies whatsoever</strong>. 
      It does not maintain sessions, track returning users, or store preferences.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">6. Security Recommendations</h2> <p>Although we do not collect or access your data, the protection of your secret keys depends on 
      your own environment. We recommend using updated browsers, avoiding public/shared devices, and 
      clearing sensitive text after use.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">7. Children’s Privacy</h2> <p>This tool is intended for developers and technical users. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p> <h2 class="svelte-7ke6fz">8. Updates to This Policy</h2> <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements or clarifications. The effective date above 
      will always indicate the latest revision.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-7ke6fz">By using the HMAC-SHA256 Generator, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy. 
      Because the tool collects nothing, your data remains yours—and yours alone.</p></article></div>`);function M(p){var e=A();k("7ke6fz",y=>{var r=b(),g=m(v(r),6);t(4),s(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/privacy`)),u(()=>{f.title="Privacy Policy | HMAC-SHA256 Generator"}),a(y,r)});var o=i(e),h=i(o);t(4),n(o),t(2),n(e),s(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/`)),a(p,e)}export{M as component,T as universal};
